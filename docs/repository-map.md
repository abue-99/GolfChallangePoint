### Next.js API proxy routes (`apps/web/app/api/`)

Contains Next.js proxy handlers for browser API traffic to NestJS. Mirrors the API structure:

```
app/api/
├── auth/             (login, signup, forgot, reset, me)
├── clubs/
├── teams/
├── users/
├── calendar/
├── lessons/
├── journeys/
├── development-plans/
├── gamification/
├── coach/            (team/player/journey assignment proxies)
├── players/
└── upload/
```

Current status: journey CRUD routes, journey assignment routes, and coach lesson assignment routes share `apps/web/lib/api-proxy-auth.ts`, which refreshes expired access tokens once and retries the backend call before returning 401. Expected flow is browser → Caddy → Next.js API route → `proxyJsonWithAuthRetry()` → NestJS with a bearer Authorization header. In production, Caddy must route `/api/journeys*`, `/api/assignments*`, `/api/coach/journeys*`, `/api/coach/players*`, and `/api/coach/teams*` to `web:3000` so these handlers execute.

### Learning lifecycle touchpoints

- **Coach player summaries**: `/teams`, `/coach/players`, `/coach`, and the coach `/dashboard` view consume `learningProgress` from coach-facing player payloads to render the mobile-first journey/lesson lifecycle overview.
- **Recent completion visibility**: compact coach cards use `recentCompletions` to show `COMPLETED` only for the last 90 days, while `PlayerOverviewDialog.tsx` keeps the full historical lifecycle counts; backend summaries depend on persisted assignment `completedAt` timestamps.
- **Player acceptance flow**: `NewAssignmentsSection.tsx`, `PlayerJourney.tsx`, and `player/queue/page.tsx` implement the `Assign → Accept → Train → Complete` flow while keeping journeys out of the queue.
- **Backend lifecycle sync**: `apps/api/src/assignments/assignment-lifecycle.ts` centralises lifecycle normalization, journey-status syncing, and coach/player learning-summary aggregation.

### Container build touchpoints

- `apps/web/Dockerfile`: filtered `golf-challenge-point-web...` install, cached Prisma generate layer, cached Next `.next/cache`
- `apps/api/Dockerfile`: filtered `api...` install, cached Prisma generate layer, shared pnpm store cache, runtime startup runs `packages/db/node_modules/.bin/prisma migrate deploy` directly (no runtime pnpm command)
- `.dockerignore`: excludes local build artifacts so context churn does not trigger unnecessary image rebuilds
